```cpp
for ( <expression_1> ; <expression_2> ; <expression_3> )
    <statement>
```
expression_1 is used for intializing variables which are generally used for controlling the terminating flag for the loop. <br>
expression_2 is used to check for the terminating condition. If this evaluates to false, then the loop is terminated. <br>
expression_3 is generally used to update the flags/variables.

sample loop 
```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    ...
}
```
